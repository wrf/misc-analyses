### treatment of IBS ###
In what appeared to be the first study of its kind, [Bensoussan et al 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9820260/) describe a randomized, double-blind, controlled study on the use of TCM for treatment of [IBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome). They note the results:

> "Compared with patients in the placebo group, patients in the active treatment groups (standard and individualized CHM) had significant improvement in bowel symptom scores as rated by patients (P=.03) and by gastroenterologists (P=.001), and significant global improvement as rated by patients (P=.007) and by gastroenterologists (P=.002). Patients reported that treatment significantly reduced the degree of interference with life caused by IBS symptoms (P=.03). Chinese herbal formulations individually tailored to the patient proved no more effective than standard CHM treatment. On follow-up 14 weeks after completion of treatment, only the individualized CHM treatment group maintained improvement."

This sounds promising, but many TCM formulas are a mixture of multiple ingredients. It is not clear if all of them are needed for the demonstrated effect, i.e. not all ingredients may be active.

The "standard formula" powdered herbs (i.e. not alcohol decoction) contained the following 20 ingredients, taken as 5x capsules, 3x per day:

Another study almost two decades later by the same authors [Bensoussan et al 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26133902/) examines only the effect on constipation-type IBS, using an overlapping set of 7 powdered herbs:

A study by [Yang 2012 Anti-Inflammatory Activities of a Chinese Herbal Formula IBS-20 In Vitro and In Vivo](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3296463/), making use of IBS20 (above, apparently derived from Tong Xie Yao Fang 痛瀉要方 and Zhong Man Fen Xiao Wan 中滿分消丸 ), found a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion from Huang Lian (黄芩). It is cited that Huang Lian is already demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory activity alone, which is why it was used alone.

### hot vs cold property ###
This is an important concept in TCM, though appears to be untested by the majority of papers, that is, accepted as true rather than tested whether it is true. I suspect this is subject to the same reductionist problem as the [four humours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humorism).

| Valence | Examples from [Li 2022](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9793677/) |
| --- | --- |
| Hot TCM | [Rou Gui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinnamomum_cassia) 肉桂, Ganjiang 干姜, and [Fuzi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aconitum_carmichaelii) 附子 |
| Cold TCM | Da Huang 大簧, [Huang Qin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scutellaria_baicalensis) 黄芩, and Huang Lian 黄芩 |

In a review of the hot-cold property, [Zhou 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34053554/) describe the confusing aspect of this principle:

> "Hot foods or CMMs trigger inflammation by different mechanisms, including the expression of COX-2 and iNOS, the production of PG, TNF-α, and IL-1β, and the activation of NF-κB. However, hot foods can even suppress the inflammation response, the relationship between the inflammation response and hot foods or CMMs can be influenced by several factors, such as the concentration of the hot food extracts, administration time of the hot foods, and the different parts of the hot foods"

In order for hot and cold to have opposite effects, they should converge onto a few pathways that can be demonstrated to have opposite responses to a range of "hot" and "cold" ingredients. They summarize one possible mechanism, which is plausible:

> "The potential mechanism of the cold-hot nature on inflammatory response indicates that cold-hot natures exert the opposite effects on the activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways, leading to the opposite effects on the expression of PGE2, COX-2, NO, iNOS, and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-β, and IL-6)."

Other studies tried to "confirm" hot versus cold patterns in the ingredients. None [Wei 2022 Cold-hot nature identification of Chinese herbal medicines based on the similarity of HPLC fingerprints](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9530746/), [Yang 2022 K Value: An Indicator that can Characterize the Cold and Hot Properties of Traditional Chinese Medicines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9133557/), [Wei 2019 Multisolvent Similarity Measure of Chinese Herbal Medicine Ingredients for Cold-Hot Nature Identification](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31765572/) make any sense to me, as it seems very unlikely that "cold" or "hot" herbs share any of the same active ingredients.
