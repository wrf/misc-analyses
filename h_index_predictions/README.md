# Prediction of future H-index #
This is based on the editorial [Predicting scientific success](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3770471/) discussing the ability to predict the [H-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index) of a researcher in 10 years, using multiple factors. Naturally, the 10 year predictions were not very accurate. The predictions for 1, 5 and 10 years were generated by:

```
#Predicting next year (R2=0.92): 
h1  = 0.76 + 0.37*sqrt(n) + 0.97*h - 0.07*y + 0.02*j + 0.03*q

#Predicting 5 years into the future (R2=0.67):
h5  = 4.00 + 1.58*sqrt(n) + 0.86*h - 0.35*y + 0.06*j + 0.2*q

#Predicting 10 years into the future (R2=0.48):
h10 = 8.73 + 1.33*sqrt(n) + 0.48*h - 0.41*y + 0.52*j + 0.82*q
```

For 1 year, it is essentially the current H index plus one (`+0.76`). In the long term, the formula indicates a greater importance of publishing in different journals (`+0.52*j`), but also having a Science/Nature/PNAS paper (`+0.82*q`).

Many researchers can get a high H-index from other reasons, such as running a shared facility or having a machine used by other labs. In my experience, I have worked with such groups several times. It is all too common that they do not write a single word of the paper, but nonetheless gain authorship. It is not even clear if they read the paper at all, particularly if it is outside of their discipline.

Of course, such facilities need *some* way of getting credit for their work (for reports to funding agencies, etc), but it is not clear to me that authorship is the best way of doing this. To me, authorship implies writing something. Proposed solutions involve categories of authors (e.g writing, experimental, funding), or simply crediting the people in the acknowledgements without authorship.
