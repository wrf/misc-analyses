# composition of milk #

## protein composition ##
Data combined from [Jensen et al 1990](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2184172/) and [Huërou-Luron et al 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20450531/)

## cortisol levels ##
Cortisol and cortisone levels vary throughout the day, with peaks in the morning ([Hollanders et al 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6412799/)),

## melatonin levels ##
Melatonin levels in breast milk peak around 3am ([Qin et al 2019](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6884443/) and [Illnerova et al 1993](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8370707/), or [Silva et al 2013](https://thescipub.com/abstract/10.3844/ajisp.2013.68.74)) but are orders of magnitude lower than tryptophan ([Cubero et al 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16380706/)). Consequently, melatonin in milk may not have much effect on the circadian rhythm of the baby, compared to tryptophan.

A tablet of 1mg melatonin (typical of melatonin supplements) = 0.004305 mmol = 4.3 umol. Suppose the amount in milk is around 50pg/mL, depending on the study. For a standard breast feeding amount of 100mL, this would be 5ng ingested by the baby. In molarity, this is appx 100pM, for 100mL milk and would be 10 picomol, so around 100000x times lower than a pill for adults. So, a 5kg baby would instead not receive an adjusted amount for adults, i.e. 20x lower than an adult of 4umol, that is 200 nmol.

The amount of melatonin used in the study by [Honorio-Franca 2013](https://jab.zsf.jcu.cz/pdfs/jab/2013/03/04.pdf) was stated to be 100nM. As above, this is still 1000-fold higher than what a baby would get in a single feeding.

> "To assess the effect of melatonin on superoxide anion release, MN or PMN phagocytes (2 × 10^6 cells/ml) were incubated with with 10 μl of Phorbol Myristate Acetate (PMA - Sigma St. Louis, USA, final concentration at 10^-7M) or 50 μl of melatonin (Sigma St. Louis, USA, final concentration at 10^-7M; França et al. 2009) for 1 h at 37degrees C. To investigate the effects of melatonin on phagocytic, microbicidal activity and intracellular Ca 2+ release, mononuclear phagocytes (2 × 10^6 cells/ml) were incubated with 50 μl of melatonin (Sigma St. Louis, USA, final concentration at 10^-7M; França et al. 2009) for 1 h at 37degrees C."

## Alcohol in milk ##
Based on the work of [Lawton 1985](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3862407/), levels of EtOH in milk effectively match blood, in either direction:

> "In all the subjects the rate of assimilation and elimination of alcohol in milk and blood were closely related... The results show that the alcohol in the milk maintains a virtually linear rate of elimination despite breast-feeding... Alcohol is eliminated by metabolism in the liver by the action of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase or by excretion in the urine. Any alcohol present in milk stored in the breast diffuses back into the blood to maintain the equilibrium during elimination."
