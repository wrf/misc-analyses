# When do women experience NVP? #
Based on the historical review by [Fairweather 1968](https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9378(68)90445-6), it appears that the writings from Ancient Greece/Rome by [Soranus of Ephesus' Gynecology](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.547535/mode/2up) (appx 100AD, using the Temkin 1956 translation) closely match up with data reported in modern times.

	"*In most pregnant women it usually sets in around the 40th day, and then persists, generally, for about four months. In some women, however, it starts earlier or later and sometimes continues for a shorter, sometimes for a longer period, while in rare cases, it has been present until parturition but in others not at all.*"

The figure below was reproduced in [Flaxman 2000](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2664252), which was a replot of the [Tierson 1986](https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9378(86)90337-6) study, which had included 414 women from Albany, NY.

They argue that this supports a **maternal-embryo protection hypothesis** (MEPH), that NVP is an adaptive mechanism for reducing exposure to potentially toxic or pathogenic foods. This is supported by some data, particularly a reduced rate of miscarriage among women with NVP, but also argued that there may be nuances [see Weigel 2006](https://doi.org/10.1515/JPM.2006.021).

# Which foods are avoided or craved? #
As with most medical literature (in my experience), they do not include supplementary tables, so the data were extracted off of the graphs.

The most confusing is the role of meat, which has both high aversions and cravings, possibly at different times (of day, between days, etc).

Fruit cravings appear to be quite common. [Weigel 2011](https://doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2011.568906) suggest this could be both due to low risk of pathogens or parasites, but also as a specific remedy for hypoglycemia, as many fruits are sweet. The authors note this could be a conditioned response to problems of repeated vomiting - i.e. low blood sugar, electrolytes, etc.
