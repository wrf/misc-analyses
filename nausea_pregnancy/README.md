# When do women experience NVP? #
Based on the historical review by [Fairweather 1968](https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9378(68)90445-6), it appears that the writings from Ancient Greece/Rome by [Soranus of Ephesus'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soranus_of_Ephesus) [Gynecology](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.547535/mode/2up) (appx 100AD, using the Temkin 1956 translation) closely match up with data reported in modern times.

"*In most pregnant women it usually sets in around the 40th day, and then persists, generally, for about four months. In some women, however, it starts earlier or later and sometimes continues for a shorter, sometimes for a longer period, while in rare cases, it has been present until parturition but in others not at all.*"

The figure below was reproduced in [Flaxman 2000](http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2664252), which was a replot of the [Tierson 1986](https://doi.org/10.1016/0002-9378(86)90337-6) study, which had included 414 women from Albany, NY.

They argue that this supports a **maternal-embryo protection hypothesis** (MEPH), that NVP is an *adaptive mechanism* for reducing exposure to potentially toxic or pathogenic foods. This is supported by a [study of 2407 women in the US](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3140259/), a [study of 51675 women in Norway](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4477493/), a [study of 91313 women in Japan](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8917715/), and a [study of 5549 women in the Netherlands](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426529/), particularly a reduced rate of miscarriage among women with NVP. A [study of 849 women in Ecuador](https://doi.org/10.1515/JPM.2006.021) argued that there may be nuances, in that NVP was only associated with reduced rate of miscarriage and not other adverse outcomes in that study.

As the microbiome is [observed to change during pregnancy](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2012.07.008) with the result that the third-trimester microbiome may favor weight gain, possibly NVP is associated with a change in microbes. The connection between NVP and pregnancy microbiome does not appear to be examined in current studies, such as the [Yang 2020](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41522-020-00142-y) study of 16S amplicon in 1479 women in China; the word "nausea" does not appear once.

# Which foods are avoided or craved? #
As with most medical literature (in my experience), they do not include supplementary tables, so the data were extracted off of the graphs.

![food_cravings_flaxman_2000_fig7.png](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/blob/master/nausea_pregnancy/images/food_cravings_flaxman_2000_fig7.png)

The most confusing is the role of meat, which has both high aversions and cravings, possibly at different times (of day, between days, etc).

Fruit cravings appear to be quite common. [Weigel 2011](https://doi.org/10.1080/03670244.2011.568906) suggest this could be both due to low risk of pathogens or parasites, but also as a specific remedy for hypoglycemia, as many fruits are sweet. The authors note this could be a conditioned response to problems of repeated vomiting - i.e. low blood sugar, electrolytes, etc.

# Risk factors of NVP #
A report by [Zhang 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7682611/) noted several risk factors for NVP, including drinking cold liquids:

> The results indicated that women who were housewives with lower gestational age, longer pre-pregnant sedentary time, lower pre-pregnant exercise frequency, high frequent (always) pre-pregnant cold drinking and a history of GI disease or an abnormal gastroscopy result were more likely to have prolonged moderate and severe NVP.

Cold water is argued to result in [slower colon transit times](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138467/), in a rat model when subjected to "gastric instillation with cold (0-4 °C) physiological saline as the cold group or room temperature (20-25 °C) physiological saline (1 mL) as the control group."

> "Cold water intake might increase the sensitivity of colonic smooth muscle to OT and then affect the colonic motility, which is involved in IBS."

Another study notes that cold water significantly [reduced distal contractile interval of the esophagus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3895613/), so this possibly has some effects on digestion overall:

> "A final consideration needs to be done on the amount of esophageal cooling. Intraluminal temperature was not measured during the experiment, however previous studies have shown that intraesophageal temperature decreased immediately after the first cold water swallow and remained stable during the whole cooling stimulus. Healthy subjects have been shown to develop chest pain associated with esophageal dilatation and absence of esophageal peristalsis during rapid ice cream ingestion and occasionally patients with dysphagia report exacerbation of symptoms during swallowing of cold food. During our experiments no one complained of dysphagia or chest pain. It is possible that stronger cooling stimuli are needed in order to induce symptoms with more severe impairment of esophageal motility. In this respect it is interesting to note that in our study impairment of swallow-induced peristalsis increased as the volume of cold water did."

The above, and other studies have examined the presence of [*Helicobacter pylori*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori) in relation to NVP. It was reported by [Grooten 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5426529/) that NVP was associated with detection of *H. pylori*, a result also repeated by the meta-analysis by [Ng 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29178407/).

# NVP among other symptoms #
Another study by [Rodriguez 2001](https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1034/j.1600-0412.2001.080003213.x) collected data from 525 pregnant women in Sweden. 

Data below were plotted from Table 2 in that study. Bars refer to percentage of the 525 women reporting some symptom. Lighter bars indicate "occasionally" experiencing (up to 2x per week), while darker bars indicate "frequently" (3x or more per week). For instance, fatigue was reported from over 90% of women at the 4 time points throughout the pregnancy, but varied in frequency.
