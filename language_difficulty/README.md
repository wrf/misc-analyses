# What is the hardest language to learn? #
A commonly asked question, though it is really two sub-questions:

* what is the hardest *second* language to learn, starting from a given first language, let's say English?
* what is the hardest *native* language to learn, as in, what language do young children struggle the most to learn in their respective countries?

## What is the hardest second language to learn? ##
This question is conceptually simpler, as it seems to depend a lot on the first language. Related languages are sometimes mutually understood, such as Norwegian and Swedish, or Spanish and Italian. Thus, a speaker of Swedish would have a relatively easy time learning Norwegian, much more so than an Italian.

The [United States State Department Foreign Service Institute](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) categorizes some languages of the world by average time to learn for native English speakers. Based on the map below, these roughly take longer with more distance from the UK.

The FSI notes that "the actual time can vary based on a number of factors, including the language learnerâ€™s natural ability, prior linguistic experience, and time spent in the classroom." I suspect that the accuracy of the timing is not well calibrated for small countries. If there were 100 students of French and 5 students of Estonian, the institute probably has a much more accurate idea of the average time to learn French than of Estonian, which is probably why most of the languages of the world are in Category III (44 hours).
