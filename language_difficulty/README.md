# What is the hardest language to learn? #
A commonly asked question, though it is really two sub-questions:

* what is the hardest *second* language to learn, starting from a given first language, let's say English?
* what is the hardest *native* language to learn, as in, what language do young children struggle the most to learn in their respective countries?

## What is the hardest second language to learn? ##
This question is conceptually simpler, as it seems to depend a lot on the first language. Related languages are sometimes mutually understood, such as Norwegian and Swedish, or Spanish and Italian. Thus, a speaker of Swedish would have a relatively easy time learning Norwegian, much more so than an Italian.

The [United States State Department Foreign Service Institute](https://www.state.gov/foreign-language-training/) categorizes some languages of the world by average time to learn for native English speakers. Based on the map below, these roughly take longer with more distance from the UK.

The FSI notes that "the actual time can vary based on a number of factors, including the language learner’s natural ability, prior linguistic experience, and time spent in the classroom." I suspect that the accuracy of the timing is not well calibrated for small countries. If there were 100 students of French and 5 students of Estonian, the institute probably has a much more accurate idea of the average time to learn French than of Estonian, which is probably why most of the languages of the world are in Category III (44 hours).

## What is the hardest native language to learn? ##
This is a more complicated question, as it relates to difficulties for children in learning their first language from their parents. That is, are there languages that are harder for children to natively acquire, or get to fluency?

The analyses below only deal with spoken language, though potentially parallels could be considered with different alphabets or writing systems. A study by [Bleses 2008](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0305000908008714) compiled results of studies measuring the pace that children learn to comprehend or speak their native language, across several European languages. The results are reproduced below. By most of the measures, [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_language) children learn to speak or understand the slowest. The authors highlight some [innate difficulties in the language](https://doi.org/10.1080/01690965.2010.515107), particularly difficulties in parsing words due to unpronounced consonants, resulting in long strings of vowel sounds.

![bleses_2008_fig4_data.png](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/blob/master/language_difficulty/images/bleses_2008_fig4_data.png)

The authors note that between ages 2-3, much of this trend disappears, as children across most languages begin to acquire more extensive vocabulary at a similar pace. However, they do not propose a reason for the relatively high performance of [Croatian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatian_language) children.

They also mention the systematically slower progression of children between UK English and US English. One reason for this may be differences in pronunciation between dialects, resulting in difficulties for British children. For example, the word "[water](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/water)" has different pronunciations in different English dialects, ranging from US /woter/, all letters pronounced), Australian or [UK RP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Received_Pronunciation) /wo:ta/, r dropped, or other UK /wo:?a/, t as a glottal stop, r dropped, sounding closer to two vowels in a row. Such words may be harder to parse at a young age.
