# Poor countries need not apply #

## ERC awards and fellowships ##
Data from [ERC statistics tables](https://erc.europa.eu/projects-figures/statistics)

Graph indicates fraction of ERC Starting Grant proposals that are awarded relative to the number applied by each country. Switzerland and Israel clearly stand out for their high performance, despite [neither being in the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union#Member_states). As of 2018, the [UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum) has the absolute highest number of both applications and awards over the decade of operation.

## Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions ##
The raw data were difficult and inconvenient to find, as they do not appear to be in the [documents or reports section](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/resources/document-library_en). These links are the stats from [2018](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/doc/call/h2020/msca-if-2018/1847614-if2018_percentiles_en.pdf), [2019](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/cap/h2020/msca-if-2019/1877616-if2019_percentiles_en.pdf), and [2020](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/docs/cap/h2020/msca-if-2020/1927651-if2020_percentiles_en.pdf).

For biological/life sciences (category ST-LIF), the cutoff for fellowship acceptance is a score of 92.6, while the median is around 82. It is not clear what is the margin of error on any given score. Applications (at least RISE, probably similarly for IF) [are evaluated](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/resources/document-libraries/guide-applicants-rise-2019_en) by "Excellence" (50%), "Impact" (30%), and "Implementation" (20%), with each category receiving a score from 0 to 5, from a minimum of 3 evaluators. So, it appears that the difference of 1 point would account for a much larger difference in outcome for Excellence than for other criteria. The distribution and breakdown of scores for individual criteria do not appear to be reported.

Data of proposals by score are only reported down to the score of 70, out of 100. Scores below 70 account for roughly 20-30% of proposals, depending on category. Most categories display a similar pattern of scores as life sciences, with the median around 80. Life sciences (ST-LIF) and social sciences (ST-SOC) have the most proposals (tied at appx 1700), while most other categories have around 1000. Two categories have substantially fewer, maths (ST-MAT) and economics (ST-ECO), each around 100-200, hence are most subject to variation in the scores (see the large spikes in the graph).
