# Is there a seasonality to human births? #

Many animals display a seasonality to migration, mating, and birth, likely coinciding with weather, food availability, offspring survival, or predator abundance. Unsurprisingly, in humans, seasonality of birth is [associated with multiple metrics of birth outcome](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1307582110), [weight at birth](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-842X.1998.tb01467.x), [risk of schizophrenia](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.167.6.783), [autism](https://doi.org/10.1176/ajp.152.5.798), and even [mortality](https://doi.org/10.1038/41245)/[lifespan](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.041431898).

Remarkably, this sounds a lot like [astrology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_astrology) or [horoscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horoscope), which are generally considered to be pseudoscience. Of course, astrology contains plausible and implausible facets. Given the above traits that are shown to be related to month of birth, perhaps a broad connection to personality, behaviour, development, or health is not unreasonable, while vague daily fortunes in the newspaper or late-night psychics are more questionable. 

An obvious test for this would be whether the effect is mirrored across the equator, i.e. that those behaving like a capricorn in the southern hemisphere should instead be born in June-July, rather than December-January. This mirroring effect, for instance, is observed in the above refs [McGrath 1995](https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.167.6.783), comparing UK to Australia, or [Doblhammer 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.041431898)), comparing Austria to Australia. More compelling evidence would be whether areas in the southern hemisphere had their own astrology or mythology that captured many of the same personality dimensions, but offset by 6 months. A difficulty here is the limited area in the southern hemisphere of temperate climates, mostly in South America (southern parts of Chile and Argentina). Large areas of both South Africa and Australia are subtropical deserts, historically unsupportive of large populations, so there may not be a detailed history of mythology or astrology from people there. Thus, the effect would then be whether migrants from the northern hemisphere show a mirrored pattern upon moving to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Chile or Argentina.

Plotted below are [monthly birth rates](https://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=POP&f=tableCode:55), for various countries, from 1967 to 2020. Not all years are available for all countries. The traces are normalized by the monthly average for that year for that country, and then adjusted for number of days in that month. The average month would be 30.4 days, so Feb has around 10 percent fewer than those with 31 days.

## Germany and Austria ##

In Austria, many studies examined effects of month of birth, including:

* [Weber 1998](https://doi.org/10.1038/35781) examined heights of 507k men, finding maximum heights for those born in April and minimum for October. They proposed that this was due to higher sun exposure following birth.
* [Doblhammer 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.041431898) included a cohort from Austria, of 681k people, arguing that those born in October-December live slightly longer than those born in springtime. They also note that those with higher education tend to be born in spring, rather than autumn.

For both Austria and Germany, births are high for summer, showing a peak in July and a peak in September. Nine months offset from these would be conceptions in October and December.

As the data only go back to the 70s for both countries, it does not give much of a historical view, that is, effectively modern culture with electric lights, hospitals, etc. One could imagine that there is no substantial advantage in modern times, and other social factors are responsible for any planning of conception (the above references may contradict this).
If these data were similar in past centuries, this may coincide with conception around the [equinox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equinox) or a [harvest festival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_festival). Compared to winter, food may be relatively abundant at this time, and could plausibly be related to the nutritional state of the mother during the first trimester. As these festivals also may involve socializing, heavy drinking and [intoxicated romance](https://www.oktoberfest.de/en/traditional-fashion/tying-a-dirndl-which-side-to-choose), this could also contribute to the July spike.

* Note: the Jan low and the Dec high in Germany are from 2002, for unclear reasons. This could be an error.

## Scandinavia ##

Again, there is a history of study on effects of month of birth, for example:

* [Samuelsson 1999](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/adc.81.2.143), examining only 1248 patients (~2:1 M:F), found highest incidence of diabetes in those born in July/August, and lowest for October. The peak of births was in April.
* [Doblhammer 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.041431898) included a cohort from Denmark, of 1.371M people, found slightly longer lifespan for those born in autumn or winter.

Overall, the birth trend is different from Germany and Austria, with a sharp spike in the springtime, and then decreasing as the year goes on. The trend is similar for all 3 countries. As time goes on, they have been changing to a more *southern* trend, with a broader peak during the late summer and fall. Possibly cultural factors play some role in this change, particularly as the time frame of the data spans births from 3 generations (children of baby-boomers, gen X-ers, and now millennials), and could potentially include major changes in city-living, job or vacation schedules, or education levels.
