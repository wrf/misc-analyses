other analyses of diverse topics, all work and opinions are my own

## [global consumption of seafood](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/fisheries) ##
Many countries with long coastlines still import a lot of their fish. Data from [UN FAO](http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FBS)

## [seasonality of human births](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/birth_rate_by_month) ##
Month of birth has real effects, like astrology, something known by all of humanity for thousands of years.

## [success in ERC grants](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/erc) ##
Countries like France and Spain have the same number of applications, but France is twice as successful. Data from [ERC statistics tables](https://erc.europa.eu/projects-figures/statistics), and from [MSCA-IF 2018 table](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/doc/call/h2020/msca-if-2018/1847614-if2018_percentiles_en.pdf)

## [ratio of annual tourists to population](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/tourism) ##
Some countries with a peak tourism season need to run at double capacity for 2-3 months, or are at half capacity for the rest of the year. Tourism arrivals data from [UN World Tourism Organization 2019 Tourism Highlights](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/book/10.18111/9789284421152) containing counts for 2018, population data are from [World Population Clock](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/).

## [prospective H-index](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/h_index_predictions) ##
Any formula can be used on any person, even if it should not, reminding us that "[when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law)"

## [high level ranks in sequence databases - moved to new repo](https://github.com/wrf/taxonomy_database) ##
Occurrence of samples from each kingdom, phylum and class in public databases. Data in the archives are dominated by model organism samples. This is also integrated into an [interactive ShinyApp map](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

## [model of intron evolution](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/intron_evolution) ##
Introns become longer by a runaway expansion model, creating an exponential distribution of length. This was a follow up to Francis 2017 [Similar ratios of introns to intergenic sequence across animal genomes.](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evx103)

## [similar ratio of introns to intergenic sequences - on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wrf/genome-reannotations) ##
Data for the paper of [Francis 2017](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evx103) showing the ratio of intronic bases to intergenic bases. Original version had 68 species, though many more have been added since.

## [oxygen usage in animals](https://github.com/wrf/misc-analyses/tree/master/animal_oxygen) ##
Data digitized from *Ecology and Evolution in Anoxic Worlds* by Fenchel and Finlay (1995).

## [bioluminescence spectra - on bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/wrf/biolum-spectra) ##
Collection of bioluminescence spectra, some original, and some digitized from old papers
