# what is the source of happiness? #

### role of diet ###
From [Hibbeln 2006 Healthy intakes of n−3 and n–6 fatty acids: estimations considering worldwide diversity](https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/83.6.1483S) and [Hibbeln 1998 Fish consumption and major depression. Lancet.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(05)79168-6). The very low rates of mental illness in Asia need to be interpretted cautiously, since there is a documented effect of [stigma against mental illness in several countries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6981757/), including Japan and Korea. It is likely that the rates reported in these studies from 20-30 years ago were systematically underestimated.

There are implications of this with respect to many different populations. Shut-ins, or [hikikomori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori), potentially end up in a vicious cycle related to diet, where withdrawal leads to a bad diet, to mood disorders, to more withdrawal. A study of 104 patients in Hong Kong found that most consume fast food and sugary drinks, and have little knowledge of cooking ([Yuen 2018](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5858384/)). A fast food diet likely has close to 0mg of omega-3 fatty acids. If this were representative of the thousands in that situation, then this is a key direction for intervention.

### antidepressants ###
Contrary to being happiest, antidepressant usage in northern Europe is high, data from [Antidepressant drugs consumption, 2000 and 2015](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/health-at-a-glance-2017/antidepressant-drugs-consumption-2000-and-2015-or-nearest-year_health_glance-2017-graph181-en). Here, [defined daily dose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_daily_dose) roughly equates to the average number of people taking medication per day (with some more, or some less).

### world happiness report ###
From the [world happiness report 2023](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2023/). This was the report that ranked Denmark as the happiest people for a few years, then was replaced by Finland for several more years. Overall, their primarily economic ranking system still ranks the West as the "happiest", despite their rampant antidepressant usage. 

The factors include [GDP per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita), "Social support", [Life expectancy at birth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy) (itself a combination of healthcare and overall health), "Freedom to make life choices", "Generosity", and "Perceptions of corruption".

### global emotions ###
From [global emotions interactive map](https://news.gallup.com/interactives/248240/global-emotions.aspx). Unlike the WHR, these surveys ask about actual emotions.

### religiousness ###
From [Okulicz-Kozaryn 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13674676.2010.550277) Does religious diversity make us unhappy?
