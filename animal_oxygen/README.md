# oxygen levels in the human body #
Compiled from various reviews and refs, [Ortiz-Prado et al 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6420699/), [Carreau et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4373326/), [Vaupel et al 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17536958/), and others. Ranges were not reported reliably for all organs, and variability may be quite high.
